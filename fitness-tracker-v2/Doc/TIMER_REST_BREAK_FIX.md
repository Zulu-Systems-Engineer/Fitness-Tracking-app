# Timer Fix: Configurable Rest Break Duration

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: The rest timer was hardcoded to 60 seconds (1 minute) regardless of the workout duration or user needs. This caused the timer to cut off after 1 minute, not reaching the minimum 5 minutes as required.

**Solution**: Made the rest break duration and frequency configurable based on the workout plan settings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated WorkoutPlan Interface
Added two new optional properties to allow customization:
```typescript
interface WorkoutPlan {
  // ... existing properties
  restBreakDuration?: number;  // Duration in minutes (default: 1)
  restBreakFrequency?: number; // Frequency in minutes (default: 5)
}
```

### 2. Configurable Rest Break Calculation
Replaced hardcoded values with dynamic calculations:
```typescript
const restBreakDurationSeconds = (plan.restBreakDuration || 1) * 60;
const restBreakFrequencySeconds = (plan.restBreakFrequency || 5) * 60;
```

### 3. Dynamic Timer Behavior
- Rest break countdown now respects the configured duration
- Rest break frequency now respects the configured interval
- Voice announcements adapt to the configured durations

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: 10-minute workout with 2-minute breaks every 5 minutes
```typescript
const workoutPlan = {
  name: "Strength Training",
  duration: 10,
  restBreakDuration: 2,    // 2-minute breaks
  restBreakFrequency: 5,   // Every 5 minutes
  exercises: [...]
};
```

**Result**: Rest break at 5 minutes, lasts for 2 minutes. Timer continues to 7 minutes, then final 3 minutes.

### Example 2: 30-minute workout with 1-minute breaks every 10 minutes
```typescript
const workoutPlan = {
  name: "Endurance Training",
  duration: 30,
  restBreakDuration: 1,    // 1-minute breaks
  restBreakFrequency: 10,  // Every 10 minutes
  exercises: [...]
};
```

**Result**: 
- Rest break at 10 minutes (1 min) â†’ 9 min remaining
- Rest break at 20 minutes (1 min) â†’ 9 min remaining
- Rest break at 30 minutes (workout ends)

### Example 3: 15-minute high-intensity workout with 30-second breaks every 3 minutes
```typescript
const workoutPlan = {
  name: "HIIT Training",
  duration: 15,
  restBreakDuration: 0.5,  // 30-second breaks
  restBreakFrequency: 3,   // Every 3 minutes
  exercises: [...]
};
```

**Result**: Multiple shorter rest breaks throughout the workout.

## Benefits

âœ… **Flexible**: Timer can now be set to any duration (1, 5, 10, 30, 50 minutes, etc.)
âœ… **Configurable**: Rest duration and frequency adapt to workout needs
âœ… **Accurate**: Timer no longer cuts off prematurely
âœ… **User-friendly**: Voice announcements reflect actual break times
âœ… **Backward compatible**: Defaults to 1-minute breaks every 5 minutes if not specified

## How It Works

1. **Workout starts** with specified duration
2. **Timer counts down** from total duration
3. **At configured intervals** (e.g., every 5 minutes), a rest break is triggered
4. **Rest break lasts** for the configured duration (e.g., 1 minute)
5. **Timer pauses** during rest break
6. **After rest break**, timer resumes and continues counting down
7. **Process repeats** until workout duration is complete

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Create a workout plan with `restBreakDuration: 5` and `restBreakFrequency: 5`
2. Start a 15-minute workout
3. At 5 minutes, you should get a 5-minute rest break
4. Timer continues properly without cutting off at 1 minute
5. Final duration: 15 minutes total (10 min exercise + 5 min rest)

The timer now properly follows the set time (10, 15, 30, 50 minutes) with configurable rest breaks! ðŸŽ‰
