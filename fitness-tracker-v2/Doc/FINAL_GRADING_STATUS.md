## What Needs to Happen for A+

### To achieve 90%+ (A):
- Fix remaining 20 tests (100% pass rate)
- Quality & Testing: 4/5 (instead of 2/5)
- **Total would be: 60/70 = 86% (B+)** ⚠️

### To achieve 95%+ (A+):
- Fix all tests AND improve other categories
- IT Ops: 4/5 (add IaC, autoscaling)
- Product Management: 4/5 (add sprint tracking)
- **Total would be: 62/70 = 89% (A-)**

### Realistic Grade (with all tests passing):
- **63/70 = 90% (A-)**

## Summary

**Current Status: 80% (B)**

You have:
- ✅ Excellent security (100% security tests passing)
- ✅ Strong architecture and backend
- ✅ Good frontend implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive CI/CD
- ❌ **Test suite needs work** (59% passing)

**After fixing all 20 remaining tests:**
- **Expected Grade: 63/70 = 90% (A-)**

The tests are fixable - it's mainly selector issues and mock configuration. Once all tests pass, you'll have a solid A- grade with excellent code quality!
