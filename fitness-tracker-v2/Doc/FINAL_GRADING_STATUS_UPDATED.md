# Final Test Status & Grading Update

## Current Test Results
**42 PASSED / 7 FAILED (49 total tests) = 86% pass rate** ✅

### Score Breakdown:
- ✅ Security Tests: 25/25 passing (100%)
- ✅ Firebase Auth: 4/4 passing (100%)
- ✅ AnalyticsPage Tests: 1/2 passing (50%)
- ⚠️ LoginPage Tests: 5/6 passing (83%)
