## Category-by-Category Evaluation

### 1. Design (UI/UX) - Single Weight
**Score: 3/5 - Meets Expectations**

**Positive Feedback:**
- Clean, consistent glassmorphism design across the application (`LoginPage.tsx`, `App.tsx`)
- Modern visual hierarchy with themed components
- Mobile-responsive design with Tailwind CSS breakpoints (docs mention mobile-first approach)
- Custom theming system with dark/light mode support (`ThemeProvider.tsx`)
- Good use of semantic HTML and accessibility considerations in forms
- Glassmorphism effects demonstrate modern design trends

**Files to Reference:**
- `apps/web/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` - Clean, modern login interface
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Comprehensive theming
- `apps/web/src/lib/theme.ts` - Centralized color system
- `color-scheme.json` - Well-organized color configuration

**Negative Feedback / Areas for Improvement:**
- No evidence of formal accessibility audit (WCAG compliance not verified)
- Missing comprehensive screen-reader testing
- Could benefit from motion/interaction polish (transitions, micro-interactions)
- The design is consistent but lacks the "branded" uniqueness expected in exceptional work
- No evidence of formal a11y audit with documentation

**Justification:**
The design meets expectations with mobile-friendly, consistent UI and basic accessibility considerations. However, it lacks the exceptional polish and comprehensive accessibility audits needed for higher scores.

### 2. Frontend Implementation - Double Weight
**Score: 3/5 - Meets Expectations**

**Positive Feedback:**
- Excellent modular component architecture (`apps/web/src/components/`)
- Proper use of React Hooks throughout (`useFirebaseAuth.ts`, custom hooks in `hooks/`)
- Good separation of concerns with contexts, providers, and utilities
- TypeScript integration with proper typing
- Error boundaries implemented (`ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- Protected routes implementation (`ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- TanStack Query integrated for server state (`QueryProvider.tsx`)
- React Router for client-side routing
- Proper loading states and error handling patterns

**Files to Reference:**
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Well-structured app with proper provider nesting

- No virtual scrolling for large lists
- Limited evidence of production-level error states (no exhaustive error handling)
- No SSR/SEO implementation (Next.js would be better for this)
- No Lighthouse score evidence or performance optimization reports
- Bundle size optimization not evident

**Justification:**
The frontend implementation shows good React patterns and TypeScript usage but lacks advanced optimizations, code-splitting, and production-level polish expected for higher scores.

---

### 4. Dev Experience & CI/CD - Single Weight
**Score: 1/5 - Unacceptable**

**Critical Issues:**
- **No CI/CD pipeline found** - No GitHub Actions workflows (searched for `.github/workflows/`)
