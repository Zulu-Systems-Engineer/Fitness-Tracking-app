# Workout Rest Break Timer - Quick Start Guide

## What's Fixed? ✅

The rest break timer now **correctly follows the set time** you configure (10, 15, 50, 30 minutes, etc.) instead of cutting off after 1 minute.

## Quick Example

### Setup
Create a workout plan with these settings:
- **Workout Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Rest Break Duration**: 10 minutes ← This now works! ✅
- **Rest Break Frequency**: Every 5 minutes of exercise

### What Happens
1. **Start Workout** → Begin exercising
2. **After 5 minutes** → Automatic rest break triggers
3. **Timer Display** → Shows "10:00" (10 minutes)
4. **Countdown** → 10:00 → 09:59 → 09:58 → ... → 00:01 → 00:00
5. **Progress Bar** → Fills gradually as time passes
6. **After 10 minutes** → Rest break ends automatically
7. **Resume Workout** → Continue with exercises

## Supported Rest Break Durations

All of these now work without cutting off:

| Duration | Display | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 minute | 01:00 | Very short break |
| 5 minutes | 05:00 | Quick break |
| 10 minutes | 10:00 | Standard break |

| 30 minutes | 30:00 | Long break |

## Common Questions

### Q: How do I change the rest break duration?
A: Edit your workout plan and change the `restBreakDuration` value (in minutes):
```typescript
restBreakDuration: 15,  // Change from 10 to 15 minutes
```

### Q: Can I pause the rest break?
A: Currently, the rest break counts down automatically. You can pause the entire workout using the Pause button.

### Q: What if I want a different break every time?
A: Currently, the duration is set per workout plan. It's the same for all breaks in that workout.

### Q: Will the timer cut off early?
A: **No!** This is what was fixed. The timer now counts down the full configured duration.

### Q: Can I skip the rest break?
A: The rest break will automatically end after the configured time. Manual skip is not currently implemented.

### Q: What if I exceed the workout time during a rest break?
A: The rest break will still complete. This is normal - you can still exercise after the configured duration ends.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Timer still shows cutting off
**Solution**: 
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R for hard refresh)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart your browser

### Issue: Rest break doesn't trigger
**Solution**:
1. Verify `restBreakFrequency` < total workout duration
2. Make sure `restBreakDuration` is set (not 0)
3. Check that workout is actually running (green "In Progress" status)

### Issue: Timer shows unusual numbers
**Solution**:
1. This is usually temporary
2. Wait a second or refresh the page
3. The timer should correct itself

2. Use your system volume to adjust
3. Or enable/disable voice if too annoying

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Test with shorter breaks first**
   - Start with 1-2 minute breaks to verify it works
   - Then increase to your preferred duration

2. **Adjust frequency based on workout type**
   - HIIT workouts: Every 5-10 minutes
   - Strength training: Every 15-20 minutes
   - Endurance training: Every 20-30 minutes

3. **Use full screen for better view**
   - Timer is most visible in full screen mode
   - Easier to see progress bar

4. **Keep voice enabled during rest**
   - Helps you know when rest break is ending
   - Provides motivation

5. **Customize to your needs**
   - No one-size-fits-all solution
   - Experiment and find what works for you
