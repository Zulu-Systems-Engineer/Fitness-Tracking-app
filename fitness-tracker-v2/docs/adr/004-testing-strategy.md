# ADR-004: Testing Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures:
- Code quality and reliability
- Regression prevention
- User experience validation
- Performance monitoring
- Security vulnerability detection
- Continuous integration support

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered testing strategy:

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest with Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Scope**: Individual functions, utilities, and hooks
- **Mocking**: Firebase services and external dependencies
- **Automation**: Run on every commit and PR

### 2. Component Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Scope**: React components in isolation
- **Focus**: User interactions, props, and state changes
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation testing
- **Visual**: Component rendering and styling

### 3. Integration Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest with custom test utilities
- **Scope**: Component interactions and API integration
- **Focus**: Data flow between components
- **Mocking**: External services with realistic responses
- **Database**: Test database operations with test data

### 4. End-to-End Testing
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile
- **Environments**: Development, staging, production
- **Performance**: Page load times and user interactions

### 5. Performance Testing
- **Framework**: Lighthouse CI
- **Metrics**: Core Web Vitals, accessibility, SEO
- **Thresholds**: Performance score > 80, Accessibility > 90
- **Automation**: Run on every deployment
- **Monitoring**: Continuous performance monitoring

### 6. Security Testing
- **Framework**: Custom security tests
- **Scope**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
- **Automation**: Run on every PR
- **Manual**: Regular penetration testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Quality Assurance**: High confidence in code quality
- **Regression Prevention**: Catch bugs before they reach production
- **User Experience**: Ensure features work as expected
- **Performance**: Maintain fast and responsive application
- **Security**: Protect against vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation

### Negative
- **Development Overhead**: Time spent writing and maintaining tests
- **Complexity**: Multiple testing frameworks and tools
- **Maintenance**: Tests need to be updated with code changes
- **False Positives**: Flaky tests can slow down development

## Alternatives Considered
- **Manual Testing Only**: Rejected due to inconsistency and time overhead
- **Unit Testing Only**: Rejected due to insufficient coverage
- **E2E Testing Only**: Rejected due to slow feedback loop
- **No Testing**: Rejected due to quality and reliability concerns

## Implementation Notes
- Write tests alongside feature development
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names and good test structure
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Fix flaky tests immediately
- Regular test maintenance and updates
- Document testing procedures and best practices
