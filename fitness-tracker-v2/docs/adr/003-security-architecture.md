# ADR-003: Security Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement comprehensive security measures to protect against:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
- SQL injection attacks
- Authentication bypass
- Data breaches
- Rate limiting abuse
- Input validation bypass

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered security architecture:

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Zod schemas** for all API request/response validation
- **Input sanitization** functions to remove dangerous content
- **HTML sanitization** for user-generated content
- **File upload validation** with type and size restrictions

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) for user permissions
- **Session management** with proper expiration
- **Password policies** with complexity requirements
- **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints

### 3. API Security
- **Helmet.js** for security headers
- **CORS** configuration for cross-origin requests
- **Request validation** middleware
- **Error handling** without information leakage
- **API versioning** for backward compatibility

### 4. Frontend Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers
- **XSS protection** with input sanitization
- **Secure cookie** attributes
- **HTTPS enforcement** in production
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI)** for external resources

### 5. Database Security
- **Parameterized queries** via Prisma ORM
- **Database connection encryption**
- **Access control** at the database level
- **Audit logging** for sensitive operations
- **Data encryption** for sensitive fields

### 6. Infrastructure Security
- **Environment variable** management
- **Secrets management** with proper rotation
- **Network security** with firewalls
- **Monitoring and alerting** for security events
- **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive Protection**: Multiple layers of security
- **Compliance**: Meets industry security standards
- **Trust**: Users can trust the application with their data
- **Maintainability**: Security measures are built into the architecture
- **Scalability**: Security measures scale with the application

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More security measures to maintain
- **Performance**: Some security checks may impact performance
- **Development Overhead**: Additional code for security measures
- **Testing**: More security testing required

## Alternatives Considered
- **Basic Security**: Rejected due to insufficient protection
- **Third-party Security Service**: Rejected due to cost and complexity
- **Minimal Security**: Rejected due to risk exposure

## Implementation Notes
- All user input must be validated and sanitized
- Implement security headers in all responses
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Regular security audits and updates
- Monitor security events and respond quickly
- Document security procedures and incident response
- Train team on security best practices
