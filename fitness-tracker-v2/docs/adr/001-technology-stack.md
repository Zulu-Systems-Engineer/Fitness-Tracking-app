# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a technology stack for the fitness tracker application that supports:
- Rapid development and iteration
- Type safety and developer experience
- Scalability and maintainability
- Modern web standards and performance
- Team collaboration and code quality

## Decision
We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for component-based UI development
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation for form handling
- **Vitest** with Testing Library for unit and component testing
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express for the API server
- **TypeScript** for type-safe backend development
- **Prisma** as the ORM for database operations
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- **Zod** for request/response validation
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Helmet** for security headers

### Development & DevOps
- **pnpm** for package management
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **Firebase** for authentication and hosting
- **Vercel/Netlify** for frontend deployment

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time error checking
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with fast hot reload
- **Performance**: Vite provides optimized builds and fast dev server
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular architecture
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy with multiple levels
- **Scalability**: Proven technologies that scale well

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to be familiar with modern React patterns
- **Bundle Size**: Multiple dependencies may increase bundle size
- **Complexity**: More moving parts compared to simpler solutions

## Alternatives Considered
- **Next.js**: Rejected due to SSR complexity for MVP
- **Vue.js**: Rejected due to team React expertise
- **MongoDB**: Rejected in favor of relational data structure
- **GraphQL**: Rejected due to complexity for current requirements

## Implementation Notes
- All new code must be written in TypeScript
- Components should be functional with hooks
- Use React Query for all server state management
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Follow the established folder structure and naming conventions
