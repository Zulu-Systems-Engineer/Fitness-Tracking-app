# Save & Toast Notification Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Toast Notifications Not Showing**
- **Problem**: Pages were using `alert()` instead of Toast notifications
- **Solution**: Added `useToast()` hook to all pages and replaced all `alert()` calls with `showToast()`

### 2. **Data Not Saving**
- **Problem**: The code was already saving to Firebase and localStorage, but error handling might have been failing silently
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling with Toast notifications for all CRUD operations

## Files Modified

### Pages with Toast Integration Added:

1. **PlansPage.tsx** ✅
   - Added `import { useToast } from '../components/ui/Toast';`
   - Added `const { showToast } = useToast();`
   - Replaced alerts with toasts for:
     - Creating workout plan
     - Updating workout plan
     - Deleting workout plan

2. **GoalsPage.tsx** ✅
   - Added toast integration
   - Toasts for create, update, delete operations

3. **TrackPage.tsx** ✅
   - Added toast integration
   - Toasts for starting workout, logging sets, completing workout, deleting workout

4. **SecurityTab.tsx** ✅
   - Removed alert() usage

## How Toast Works

The Toast system is already configured in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
<ToastProvider>
  {/* All routes */}
</ToastProvider>
```

Toast component shows:
- **Success** messages (green with checkmark)
- **Error** messages (red with X icon)
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- Can be manually closed

## Testing the Fix

1. **Workout Plans**:
   - Go to `/plans`
   - Click "Create New Plan"
   - Fill out the form
   - Click "Create Plan"
   - ✅ You should see a green success toast
   - ✅ Plan should appear in the list

2. **Goals**:
   - Go to `/goals`
   - Create a new goal
   - ✅ Success toast appears
   - ✅ Goal appears in list

3. **Tracking**:
   - Start a workout from `/track`
   - ✅ Success toast appears
   - Log a set
   - ✅ Success toast for set logged
   - Complete workout
   - ✅ Success toast appears

## If It's Still Not Working

Check the browser console for errors:
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab
3. Look for any error messages

Common issues:
- Firebase not configured (check `.env` file)
- Browser localStorage disabled
- Network errors

## Next Steps

1. **Start the dev server**: `npm run dev` in `apps/web`
2. **Open browser**: `http://localhost:5173`
3. **Login**: Create account or login
4. **Test**: Try creating a workout plan
5. **Check**: Look for toast notifications in top-right corner

## Debugging

If toasts still don't show:
1. Check if `ToastProvider` is wrapping the app in `App.tsx`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Firebase is configured
4. Check network tab for failed requests
